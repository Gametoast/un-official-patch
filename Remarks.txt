  missing textures (from stock req, not needed):
    noise
    redlaser_1
    spray
    walker_icon

  checked:
    effects - binary equal
    config - binary equal
    hud - binary equal
    msh - largely binary equal
    lua - verified
    animation - binary equal
    odf - binary equal
    texture - recovered has too many textures (rep_icon, all_icon, cis_icon, imp_icon)
              they come from common and are added automatically because they are used
              with the flag items in the odf folder. IDK why they are not added in the
              uop ingame. Anyway it wouldn't hurt if they are missing in ingame, since
              they are already in common. MAYBE be a problem of the custom munge tool
              Anyway it does not hurt if they are there twice.

  binary unequal textures (but they look the same)
    com_sfx_laser_orange.tga - different color
    com_sfx_scorchmark.tga - no visible differences

  binary unequal msh
    com_bldg_ctfbase.msh - no visible differences
    hud_arrow.msh -  no visible differences
    hud_force_pull.msh -  no visible differences
    hud_force_push.msh -  no visible differences
