Overview
* This tutorial will guide you through munging a custom lvl file

Requirements
* SWBF2 mod tools
* Basic understanding of modding
* Basic understanding of the munge process

How To Do It
1) This guide will assume the mod map is XXX
2) Create the folder: "data_XXX\Shell"
3) Create the text file: "data_XXX\Shell\shell.req"
4) Create the folder "data_XXX\Shell\scripts"
5) Create the script file: "data_XXX\Shell\scripts\test.lua"
6) In shell.req, add the following code.  The 'test' should match the name of the script created in step 5, but without its file extension:

ucft
{
    REQN
    {
        "script"
        "test"
    }
}

7) Open VisualMunge, click "Unselect All", check "Shell", click "Munge"
8) When VisualMunge finishes, it will have created the lvl file: "data_XXX\_LVL_PC\shell.lvl"
9) Rename shell.lvl to whatever name you need, then move it to where you need the file.

Notes
* The test.lua script is just an example script file.  You should change the req file to reflect whatever it is you are trying to munging.
